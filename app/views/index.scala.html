    Sign in with Slack</a>

<div>
The application forwards personal email notifications from GitLab to a direct message in Slack. By forwarding notifications to Slack, we can communicate better and be more accountable for our activities.
</div>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<div>
When you sign in with the "Sign in with slack" button, you are given an email address. Emails to this address are forwarded to a direct message in Slack, so you can set up GitLab to notify you with this email address so that you can receive notifications in Slack.
Because it's formatted for readability when it's forwarded, you'll receive the notification in a more readable format than if you were to receive it through Slack's built-in features.
</div>
<div>
If you have multiple workspace accounts in Slack, be sure to sign in with the workspace you want to receive notifications from.
If you are the first workspace to sign in to the app, you'll see an "Add to Slack" button.
</div>
<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How much is it?</h3>

It's free (at least for the time being). We're offering it for free for now because we use a low-cost infrastructure to operate it.

<h3>Who is developing it?</h3>

It is mainly developed by Takashi Kawachi.
The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/tkawachi/gitlab-slack-forwarder">https://github.com/tkawachi/gitlab-slack-forwarder</a>.
